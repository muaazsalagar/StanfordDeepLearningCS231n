**** What triggered "The Big Bang of Evolution" Speciation during 543 million years BC?
</****>

  Speciation exploded because during this time because of  because prominent theory by Andrew Parker is that it was onset of eyes.

  Once predators started to see by they could eat efficiently by hunting them or by tracking them and eventually preys also started to develop the eyes. Early version for these would be just like a simple pin hole camera. And this mechanism started of a kind of biological warfare.

One important Experiment: Cat shown images of food and what was triggering the neurons?

> One most important observation was : The edge changes of the images did the actual neuron triggering so it can be said that early vision started with simple image detections.


> Normalized Cut: First Real world problem solved.

 Focusing on features:
 instead of taking full image information, we should just focus on the features and we can then detect entire image even in the clutter.

 Around 2009 we wanted a kind of benchmarking and it started with 20 Images (PASCAL work) and each year every group started to test on that image data.
 Lead to ImageNET

 2012: A Convolution Neural Network shows its massive power at ImageNEt and won the challenge.

Class will focus more on:
  Object detections
  Action classification
  Image Captioning

History of  CNN:
  LeCun (1998)-He had worked on the OCR. That product later on shipped to the postal offices, banks.
  The process was to focus on the parts of the image data and then layer by layer filter the data and pull together.

  Same architecture used in ImageNET 2012 challenge.


Why CNN was more successful now?
  > 1) More Computing power (GPUs) Thanks to NVDIA probably Gamers too! :D
    2) More availability of Data so better model can be built and hence more accuracy.

What is holy grail of a Computer Vision?
  Give a picture and it should be able to tell a story out of it.
